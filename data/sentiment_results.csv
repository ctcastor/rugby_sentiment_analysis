It's like I feel somehow guilty and worried, that guys there played their game, fought till the last drop of blood, reaching their goal and scoring an overwhelming winning try  for what? nothing, the TMO was either blind or not cappable of wearing pants.

"Ok, I guess no one is happy here with either the game or the outcome of it. As a frenchman, I felt very disappointing with the level of play we produced on field (or the absence of) and I also 100% understand why the scots would feel like we've been robbed. That being said... 1. scots only scored 3 point between the 29th minute and the end of the game (even with a yellow card for the French), 2. as unfortunate as it is, the final decision is consistent with the current rules of the game. While we all agree the ball was probably grounded, there is no clear evidence of it and with an on-field no try decision the outcome is no try. It's frustrating, it's whatever you want, but it's consistent. All in all, not a great game, lots of frustration on both sides, not the type of rugby we (I) want to watch on the weekend... Lovely atmosphere it seemed though, and we don't expect less from Murrayfield!",0,Agree:4,Agree,4

"To be honest I really think this game should be a prime example in opening up a new discussion as to how a on the line try is awarded where players are in a huddle like that. <br><br>In my opinion the TMO has had basically a nightmare decision to make and has no choice in that but to go with the letter of the law. The ref has done a very bad job imo by outright declaring his decision to TMO before any check is made.<br><br>In my opinion, the officiating now needs either 1 of 2 things because this is a decision everyone will feel is not right. <br><br>1. The ref and the TMO act as two separate referee officials that can make a decision freely on their end. The ref is the onfield official and any decisions he makes is taken as final throughout the course of the game. So yellow card challenges where the ref clearly believes its a yellow card is a sin bin and thats that (apart from high tsckle challenges as I do agree having them go to TMO review as the player is initially in a sin bin for 10 minutes is a good decision and immediately removes any break from the natural flow of the game.). Where a challenge is contentious and is a red card, it would be good for the ref to use the red card to take a player off field and use the TMO 10 minute review to ensure the decision is upheld or not. <br><br>However for trys especially a try that is game winning, the TMO should be then allowed to declare to the ref his belief or opinion where a ball is a try or not, rather then having to provide all sorts of evidence to say the on field decision is wrong.<br><br>2. I prefer this idea persoanlly. 1 is convoluted and Im not too sure how you would make this work. However for me option 2 would involve bringing new technology to the game. Something basically like goal line technology where a rugby ball can be determined as to whether it has reached the try line or not. This for me would make the law the TMO currently has way more accessible as what it would mean is a system where all the players involved are taken out of the shot, and only the rugby ball and the try line are considered.",0,Disagree:4,Disagree,4

And In my opinion  the officials did a great job with the final outcome. Even the TMO was trying hard to give a decision to overturn it but it just wasn‚Äôt 100%. I‚Äôm a neutral but wanted Scotland to win as I feel it‚Äôs long overdue that they should be in for a 6N Title. Hoping they can bounce back and be great to see Scotland and Italy be occupying 1st and 2nd place, wishful thinking but would be a welcome change for the neutrals amongst us! Rugby won and must say FINN is on another level! MS is the FINN that England need. These mavericks come once in a bluemoon and by good grace coaches should utilise them for there style of play, more of seeing whats in front of them and less of structured play.

Fickou's try was nothing like that, a ball spun out to the wing, classic rugby at its best.  There's got to be something to change how the game is played, whether cutting down the amount of subs to 4 per match, or allowing lineout play inside the 5 meter line, as so many 5 meter lineouts end up as mauls, powered by these hulking players.",14,Disagree:4,Disagree,4
