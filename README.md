The 2024 Six Nations rugby clash between Scotland and France delivered a gripping and controversial moment in the final seconds, where an inconclusive try review determined the outcome. For those unfamiliar with rugby, a try invovles scoring points by grounding the ball in the opposition's in-goal area. Trailing 16-20 with no time left on the clock, Scotland had one more chance to score a try and secure a dramatic victory over France.

Scotland's Sam Skinner powered over the line, met by a swarm of bodies as he attempted to ground the ball. Amid the tangle of players, the ball is visible just above the yellow boot. To validate a try, the ball must be firmly grounded.

On-field referee Nic Berry initially ruled no-try but requested a video review from Television Match Official (TMO) Brian MacNeice.

Despite potential evidence suggesting otherwise, MacNeice asserted that there was no definitive proof to confirm Skinner scored, giving France a nerve-wracking 20-16 victory.
